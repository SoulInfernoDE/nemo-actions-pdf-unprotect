# nemo-actions-pdf-unprotect

integrate permanent password removal of pdf-files into the right click nemo file manager
actions menu after entering the password of the pdf file once

Status of the script:
- UNFINISHED / WIP (WORK IN PROGRESS / NOT WORKING YET -

Intention:
Easy and fast add-on for the linux mint file manager to permanently remove passwords of
protected pdf-files and store them unprotected without the hassle
of typing a long command line again and again.

Installation instructions:
..will follow asap if the script is completed and working fine.
After that i will try to package the script and the files so it will
be made easially installable..


base script idea (c) by Alfcx. Thank you for providing the base idea.
Added idea of making the script changes to be able to right-click remove pdf-passwords by me.
